## Description

Introducing **Funcy**, a Web3-enabled mobile app revolutionizing IRL events. Attendees, organizers, crews, and vendors all benefit from seamless experiences. Attendees can effortlessly purchase goods within event venues using Solana SPL tokens. Developed with React Native and Solana's web3.js library, **Funcy** offers smooth functionality. Registration is simple via email or phone number, creating a Solana account for users through account abstraction. Say goodbye to traditional event hassles and hello to a new era of streamlined transactions and enhanced event experiences with **Funcy**.

## Vision

**Funcy** aims to revolutionize event experiences by simplifying management for organizers and enhancing convenience for attendees. By enabling seamless transactions with Solana SPL tokens, it transforms in-venue purchases into effortless and enjoyable transactions. Moreover, by providing many users with their first crypto experience, **Funcy** opens the door to "the next billion users" in the Solana ecosystem. Through these innovations, **Funcy** seeks to create a significant impact, streamlining event operations, enriching attendee experiences, and fostering widespread adoption of cryptocurrency technology.
